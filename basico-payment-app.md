# Basico Payment App \(Brazilian Payments\)

Today at basico.com, we use a Payment Gateway called Adyen, which is supported by a local merchant called Cielo. Unfortunately, Shopify does not allow us to use Adyen seamlessly. As Brazilian merchants we feel that Shopify was forcing us to change our Payment Gateway negociation just because they have a poor brazilian support. We dont want that, thats why we are going to create this app.

## So, what this app Does?

This app allow us to have Full control about which Gateway we want to use on our payment. It allow us to support Payment Partners which are not supported by Shopify natively. Shopify argues that its very difficult to mantain support to several Gateways, so they do it Slowly, and always though ActiveMerchant.

With this app, we can choose which Merchant we will support, and do it through a transparent checkout, as we have today.
