# Basico Shipping App

Today at basico.com, we use what Shopify understand as "CarrierCalculated Rates", which is basically a dynamic way to calculate the Order Shipping based on which products you have on your shopping cart.

Shopify today offers 2 static ways of calculating shipping options: by "Weight Range", and by "Order Total Range".

Also, you can Setup a Fixed Shipping amount, but its not our case.

## So, what this app Does?

This App allow us to have Full control about which rules we will enable in our Shipping Service. This solution Nullify the Shipping management section at Shopify Admin, since we cannot configure our Shipping Rules by Shopify Admin anymore, but it give us full flexibility to decide which rules we want to apply on our customer checkout.

This way we can create customized rules for Free Freight, Fixed Rates \(Loggi\), or even prices coming directly from Correios.

Solving the Shipping problem, we move to the next section...
