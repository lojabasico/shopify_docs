# Basico NF App \(Brazilian Invoices\)

Today at basico.com, we use a B2B service known as "Bling", which allow us to generate the Brazilian Invoice and emit it directly on the Brazilian Government systems. We decided to use this B2B service, because we understand that there are a lot of bureaucracies required to make this work.

At Shopify, there are no native tools to help us on this \(except for a TinyERP App\), and furthermore, we didnt wanted to change all of our Invoice Generation Flow just because we are moving from one Platform to another.

## So, what this app Does?

This App allow us to have Full control about which tool we will use to control and generate our Customer Invoices.

Solving the Invoice problem, we move to the next section...
